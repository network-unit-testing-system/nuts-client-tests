# NUTS Test Cases for Linux Clients

This project is the home for (Linux) client tests for the pytest plugin ``nuts``. 
For example, the Ubuntu-based container ``nuts-testclient`` can be used as a client. To establish the SSH connection Netmiko with the device_type Linux is preferred. The Nornir inventory must be prepared accordingly.

Ideas for new valuable test cases are very welcome. Feel free to open an issue.
